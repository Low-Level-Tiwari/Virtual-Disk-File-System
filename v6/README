Data Structure:
---------------
	
	Bit Array: It is a Sequence of Bits of length 'n' where every access is bit-wise

	In C language, 'unsigned char' array is a reasonable approximation of bit array, where every element of array is 
	considered as a Byte (size of char is 1 byte) and masking is used to access/modify values of Bits in that Byte.


	read(array,i): Returns value present at i'th bit in array
	write1(array,i): Writes 1 at i'th bit in array
	write0(array,i): Writes 0 at i'th bit in array




Algorithm:
----------

	Encoding
	--------
		
		  Every byte is prepended with bits '1' and whole array is byte aligned, finally bits '0' are appended in 
		  the end to mark the ending of Bit sequence.


		1. Calculate Size of Encoded string and create bit array.

			output size = Input Size + ceil((Input Size + 1)/8)
			

		2. Write '1' and then write 8 bits of data.
		3. Repeat step 2 for every byte.
		4. Finally append '0' at the end.

	
	Decoding
	--------
		
		For every occurance of '1' read 8 Bits of data and repeat this till '0' pattern is reached.





Computational View
-------------------

	byte(byte)* is transformed to 1byte(1byte)*0

	Due to kleen closure, the program will require one loop
